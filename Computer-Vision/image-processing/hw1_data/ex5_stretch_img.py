Purpose: Linearly stretch the gray scale intensities of an input image
based on the cutoff fraction, f, provided on the command-line.  First
we find the maximum intensity --- call it g0 --- such that f of the
pixels have intensity less than or equal to g0.  Then we find the
minimum intensity --- call it g1 --- such that 1-f of the pixels in
the image have intensity greater than or equal to g1.  Then we map the
intensities as follows:

  . All intensities <= g0 are mapped to 0
  . All intensitiess >= g1 are mapped to 255
  . Intensities from g0 to g1 are linearly stretched into the range
    [0,255]

NumPy:  This demonstrates the use of NumPy histograms, cumulative
distributions, the where function, indexing with a boolean array, and
image arithmetic.
